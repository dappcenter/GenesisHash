# GenesisHash

Script to auto-generate genesis and merkle hashes
This script will 
1. Install python and dependencies (If you already have them please remark them out)
2. clone GenesisH0 and mine the genesis blocks of main, test and regtest networks (this may take about an hour.  Ctrl-C if it takes too long but ignore the lengthy time displayed by python)

run this in Ubuntu16.04LTS enviornment or VM

cd to the GenesisHash-master directory 
sudo ./generator.sh generate_hashes
